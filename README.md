The Task Management System is a full-stack web application designed to help users create, organize, and track their daily tasks or team projects efficiently.
It allows users to add, update, delete, and monitor tasks while keeping everything organized in one place.

This project is ideal for teams and individuals who want to improve productivity and manage work progress using a clean and modern interface.

Key functionalities include user authentication (login & registration), role-based access (Admin/User), and task status tracking with categories like Pending, In Progress, and Completed.
The dashboard provides a quick overview of all tasks and their current statuses to make management easier.

Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), this project demonstrates how to connect a powerful backend API with a responsive, dynamic frontend using React for state management.
